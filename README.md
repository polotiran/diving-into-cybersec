# diving-into-cybersec
A collection of my labs and reflections about cybersecurity.
As the labs will be made on Qemu/KVM virtual machines you can find a quick introduction to this virtualization stack [here](diving-into-cybersec/virt-stack).

## Objectives
This repository is meant to:
- **Document** my journey in learning cybersecurity.
- **Showcase** labs for practice and experimentation.
- **Share** reflections and insights on challenges I faced during my labs.

## Repository Structure
- **virt-stack** → a quick introduction to using Qemu/KVM (with libvirt BUT without GUI because it would be too easy and much less fun :) )
- **labs** → well I think the name's self-explanatory
- **resources** → here you'll find all the **documentation** I write and links to resources you may find **useful or interesting**

## License
All code and documentation in this repository are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
I decided to use this so that if you use what you find here for malicious purposes I cannot be held responsible :)

## Time
This repository is made for me to document my learnings.
I take time to **understand, document, and experiment** everything.
Content **will grow** as I learn and document, but as it is not a collection of pre-existing resources it **_does take time_** to create.
